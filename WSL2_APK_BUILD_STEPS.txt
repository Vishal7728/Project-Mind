PROJECT MIND - WSL2 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

Since WSL2 is not installed, follow these steps:

STEP 1: INSTALL WSL2
========================================

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run this command:

   wsl --install -d Ubuntu

3. After it completes, RESTART YOUR COMPUTER
4. It will complete setup on next boot (may take 5-10 minutes)
5. Create username and password when prompted

Once Ubuntu is set up, proceed to STEP 2


STEP 2: BUILD THE APK IN WSL2
========================================

1. Open PowerShell (normal, not admin needed)
2. Type: wsl
3. This opens Ubuntu terminal

4. Copy and paste this ENTIRE command block:

   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && \
   sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip openjdk-11-jdk-headless build-essential git libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev && \
   pip install buildozer Cython==0.29.33 virtualenv && \
   pip install kivy Pillow && \
   cd /mnt/d/Project\ Mind && \
   buildozer android release

5. Wait for completion (15-30 minutes for first build)
6. APK will be at: d:\Project Mind\bin\projectmind-1.0.0-release.apk


ALTERNATIVE: Use Docker (FASTER, NO SETUP)
========================================

If you want to skip WSL2 setup, use Docker instead:

1. Install Docker Desktop from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Run:
   cd d:\Project\ Mind
   docker-compose up
3. APK created at: d:\Project Mind\bin\projectmind-1.0.0-release.apk


ALTERNATIVE 2: Use GitHub Actions (CLOUD BUILD, EASIEST)
========================================

1. Push this project to GitHub
2. Actions automatically builds APK
3. Download from workflow artifacts
4. No local setup required!


AFTER GETTING APK
========================================

Install on Android device:

1. Enable USB Debugging on device (Settings → Developer Options)
2. Connect device via USB
3. In PowerShell, run:

   adb install -r "d:\Project Mind\bin\projectmind-1.0.0-release.apk"

4. Launch app on device


TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

"wsl command not found":
- Windows 10/11 Build 18917 or later required
- May need to enable Hyper-V and virtualization in BIOS

"Docker: file not found after build":
- Docker takes longer first time
- Wait for "successfully built" message
- Check that docker-compose.yml exists

"APK installation fails":
- Ensure Android 13+ on device
- Enable USB Debugging (Settings → Developer)
- Try: adb devices (to verify connection)
