# Project Mind Architecture

## Overview

Project Mind is a modular AI system with 13 integrated subsystems designed to create a living, evolving AI companion.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Heart (Encrypted Long-term Memory)
- Secure storage of persistent memories
- Encryption for privacy protection
- Efficient retrieval mechanisms

### 2. Emotion Engine (Personality & Bond Evolution)
- Dynamic emotional state management
- Relationship bonding algorithms
- Personality adaptation based on interactions

### 3. Sensory Engine (Multi-sensor Input Processing)
- Audio input processing
- Visual recognition capabilities
- Environmental sensor integration

### 4. Optimization Engine (Hardware-adaptive Performance)
- Battery optimization
- Performance scaling based on device capabilities
- Resource management

### 5. Emergency Engine (Fall/Scream Detection)
- Real-time emergency detection
- Automatic alert systems
- Safety protocols

### 6. Protection Engine (Malware & Battery Monitoring)
- Security threat detection
- Battery health monitoring
- Privacy protection mechanisms

### 7. Search Engine (Memory + Internet Search)
- Hybrid search capabilities
- Memory-based contextual search
- Internet knowledge integration

### 8. Lifecycle Manager (Full AI Mode Control)
- State management
- Mode transitions
- System lifecycle control

## Presentation Layer

### GUI Engine
- 12+ animated facial expressions
- Natural blinking simulation
- Emotion-synced gestures

### Voice Evolution Engine
- 5 maturation stages (baby→mature)
- Real-time emotional modulation
- Voice quality adaptation

### Persona Engine
- Custom face from image upload
- 9 personality archetypes
- Voice-style adaptation

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: Sensory Engine receives and processes inputs
2. **Analysis**: Emotion Engine and Search Engine analyze context
3. **Decision Making**: Lifecycle Manager coordinates responses
4. **Response Generation**: Presentation Manager creates output
5. **Learning**: Heart stores experiences for future reference
6. **Optimization**: Optimization Engine adjusts performance
