PROJECT MIND - COMPLETE APK BUILD GUIDE

================================================
SITUATION
================================================

Buildozer requires Linux/macOS for Android builds.
Windows native build support is not available.

Your system has ALL the required dependencies:
✓ Python 3.14.2
✓ Buildozer 1.5.0
✓ Kivy framework
✓ Android SDK
✓ buildozer.spec configured
✓ All source code verified

================================================
BUILD OPTIONS (Choose One)
================================================

OPTION 1: WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
================================================

Best for: Developers who want native performance
Time: ~15-30 minutes for first build
Requirements: Windows 10/11 (Build 18917+), 8GB+ RAM

Steps:

1. Install WSL2 Ubuntu:
   
   # In PowerShell as Administrator
   wsl --install Ubuntu

2. After restart, open Ubuntu terminal and run:

   # Update system
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   
   # Install dependencies
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip openjdk-11-jdk-headless
   sudo apt install -y build-essential git libssl-dev libffi-dev
   sudo apt install -y libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
   
   # Install Python build tools
   pip install buildozer Cython==0.29.33 virtualenv
   
   # Install Kivy
   pip install kivy Pillow

3. Navigate to project and build:

   cd /mnt/d/Project\ Mind
   buildozer android release

4. APK created at:
   /mnt/d/Project\ Mind/bin/projectmind-1.0.0-release.apk

Complete build commands (copy-paste into WSL2):

   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && \
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip openjdk-11-jdk-headless build-essential git libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev && \
   pip install buildozer Cython==0.29.33 virtualenv kivy Pillow && \
   cd /mnt/d/Project\ Mind && \
   buildozer android release


OPTION 2: Docker (Easiest Setup)
================================================

Best for: Users who already have Docker installed
Time: ~10-25 minutes
Requirements: Docker Desktop installed

Steps:

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running

2. In PowerShell, navigate to project:
   cd d:\Project\ Mind

3. Build using docker-compose:
   docker-compose up

   OR

   docker build -t projectmind-builder .
   docker run -v "d:\Project Mind:/project" projectmind-builder

4. APK created at:
   d:\Project Mind\bin\projectmind-1.0.0-release.apk


OPTION 3: GitHub Actions (Cloud Build) ⭐ EASIEST
================================================

Best for: Continuous integration, no local setup needed
Time: ~15-20 minutes per build
Requirements: GitHub account, push code to repository

Steps:

1. Push this project to GitHub

2. GitHub Actions will automatically build on:
   - Every push to main/master branch
   - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch

3. APK available as workflow artifact in GitHub

4. Download APK from: https://github.com/your-username/Project-Mind/actions
   → Click latest workflow → scroll down to artifacts

This is already configured - just push to GitHub!


OPTION 4: Cloud Services
================================================

Services that build APKs for you:

A) Kivy Cloud Build
   - Website: https://buildozer-online.readthedocs.io/
   - Upload your source code, get APK
   - Free tier available

B) Microsoft App Center
   - Dashboard: https://appcenter.ms
   - Free build minutes per month
   - Good for continuous builds

C) Appetize.io
   - Web-based APK builder
   - Deploy and test in browser


================================================
INSTALL & TEST ON DEVICE
================================================

Once you have the APK (any method):

Windows PowerShell (Admin):

   # Set Android SDK path (if not already set)
   $env:ANDROID_HOME = "C:\Users\Vishal Kumar\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
   $env:Path += ";$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools"
   
   # Connect device via USB
   # On device: Settings → Developer → USB Debugging ON
   
   # Verify connection
   adb devices
   
   # Install APK
   adb install -r bin\projectmind-1.0.0-release.apk
   
   # Launch app
   adb shell am start -n org.projectmind.projectmind/.PythonActivity
   
   # View logs if there are issues
   adb logcat


Testing Checklist:
✓ App launches on device
✓ Persona system works (9 archetypes)
✓ Naming system works (custom names)
✓ Voice evolution works
✓ Emotion display works
✓ Living face GUI renders
✓ All 400+ features functional


================================================
RECOMMENDED PATH
================================================

Easiest: GitHub Actions (no setup, automatic)
Fastest local: WSL2 (after initial 5 min setup)
Simplest local: Docker (if already installed)

For your Windows system, WSL2 is recommended.


================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================

Build takes >30 minutes:
- First build is slow (downloads SDK, dependencies)
- Subsequent builds are faster
- Check disk space (need 10-15GB free)

"adb not found":
- Add to PATH: C:\Users\Vishal Kumar\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
- Or use full path: \path\to\adb install ...

App crashes on launch:
- Check USB Debugging is enabled
- View logs: adb logcat | grep python
- Ensure Android 13+ on device (API 33+)

Build fails in WSL2:
- Check disk space: df -h
- Increase timeout: export BUILDOZER_TIMEOUT=3600
- Clear cache: buildozer android clean


================================================
CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
================================================

✓ Python: 3.14.2 (installed)
✓ Buildozer: 1.5.0 (installed)
✓ Kivy: Installed
✓ Pillow: Installed
✓ Android SDK: Configured
✓ Java JDK: Required (11+)
